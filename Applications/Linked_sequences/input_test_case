# Column indices for data file, in the order: ID, age, delta age, intensity, delta intensity, data type, age distribution, stratification, likelihood
# where column 0 is the first, column 1 is the second etc.
#
# File_format (9 integer numbers): These specify which columns of the data file should be read, in the order below.
# ID 1 : the column number of the sample ID (assumed to be text) 
# Age 2 : the column number of the mean sample age
# delta age 3 : the column number for the age uncertainty; interpreted as the half-interval range for a uniformly distributed age or the standard deviation for a normally distributed age
# intensity 4 : the column number of the mean sample intensity
# delta intensity 5 : the column number of the standard deviation of the intensity 
# data type: -1 if not relevant; 'O'(ther); P, B, C, S: pottery, brick, baked clay, slag.
# age distribution: -1: ALL the data ages are distributed uniformly (half-width given by the delta age) ; -2: ALL the data ages are distributed normally (with mean given by the age, and standard deviation given by delta age)
# stratification: column number specifying stratification information or -1 if stratification is to be ignored
# intensity likelihood -1 : the column number specifying the intensity likelihood; -1  if all sample likelihoods normally distributed (this is the usual case)

# Data type:  If data type is not specified as column data, set this parameter to -1. All data will be assigned a type "O" (other).
#
# Age distribution of data: If age distribution is globally specified (and is not specified by column data):
#  -1 is uniform (with centre point given by the read age, and half-width given by the read delta age)
#  -2 is normal distribution (with mean given by the read age, and standard deviation given by delta age)
#
# Stratification: the column containing stratification information (in the column data: 0 is unstratified, non zero indicates stratification).
# To ignore stratification, set the stratification parameter to -1
